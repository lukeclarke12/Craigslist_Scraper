# Craigslist_Scraper
In this project, I have created a algorithm to scrape relevant information from a specifically filtered craigslist page ( such as product title, price, location and url ) and then store this information in an excel file so it can be easily analysed.

Libraries used:

Selenium, 
BeautifulSoup, 
Urllib, 
CSV
